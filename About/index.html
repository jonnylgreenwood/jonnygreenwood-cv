      Hey, I'm Jonny born n' bred in sunny Leeds. I grew up a fairly nerdy kid, and honestly, that hasn’t changed
      much. I studied Chemistry at Sheffield Hallam University, where I discovered that I loved working with data far
      more than working in the lab. I graduated with a First-Class BSc (Hons), and not long after, I joined Johnson &
      Johnson.

      There, I cultivated my love for data and found my stride in project work, bringing new tools and ideas to turn
      tedious analytics into something much more dynamic (a bit like taming a wild puppy and ending up with a loyal
      companion). After working in the EMEA demand planning team, I moved into commercial analytics, working closely
      with Sales and Pricing Strategy. One of my proudest moments was simplifying a notoriously complex NHS framework
      and, quite by accident, creating one of the best ways to model every company’s pricing structure. (NHS England —
      my DMs are open.)

      From there, I joined the Spine End-to-End Planning team, where I touched nearly every part of the supply chain and
      helped plan the launch of new products.

      More recently, I took a sabbatical to travel, volunteer, and live a little differently. I love an adventure — and
      while most people plan a beach holiday, I tend to wonder if I can get from A to B on horseback, and more
      importantly, who’s in charge of the music. You can follow along on my <a
